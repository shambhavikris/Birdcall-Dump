# Cornell-Birdcall-Identification
In Kaggle competition, made an Audio Processing Pipeline, using PyDub, TensorFlow and Keras, creating a final set of binary TensorFlow Record files. With minimal RAM, Mel Spectrograms generated using Librosa were fed to train a WaveNet-like model for multi-class classification for 264 classes. A feature extraction layer from trained ResNet has also been applied.
